Pseudo code

Algorithm 1

set largest = 0
While true:
	request user to input a positive value
	
	if number is 0
		exit loop
	if number is greater than largest
		set number to the largest number entered
 
Output largest number entered

Algorithm 2

set first_name to request user to input name.
	
	print first_name + "Hello World"


Algorithm 3

set total to 0
set counter to 0
while true:
	request user to input an integer
    if input is 0, 
		exit loop
	add input to total
	increase counter
 
 if counter not 0:
	set average to total divide by counter
	Output average
 else:
	Output "No integer were entered"


Algorithm 4

Read grocery_list from input and store it in a list

Read purchased_items from input and store it in a list

Sort the grocery_list in alphabetically

print grocery_list

Create an empty list called left_to_buy

For each item in grocery_list:
    If the item is not in purchased_items
		add it to left_to_buy
		sort left_to_buy alphabetically
	
For each item in left_to_buy:
    Print the item

Algorithm 5

request user to enter any integer and set it as x
request user to enter any integer and set it as y

set S to x+y
set A to S/2
set P to x*y

print S
print A
print P
